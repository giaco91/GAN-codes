# GAN-codes
The aim of this repo is to build my own deep learning library of example implementation in pytorch most of which have a GAN component.

##Deep image prior
The file "dip.py" is a vanilla implementation for inpaining that uses the deep image prior only.

##Deep convolutional autoencoder
The file "dc_ae.py" is a vanilla implementation for a deep convolutional autoencoder.

##Deep convolutional GAN
The file "dc_gan.py" is a vanilla implementation of a deep convolutional GAN.

##Deep convolutional E-GAN
The file "e_gan.py" is a vanilla implementation of a deep convolutional evolutionary GAN.
